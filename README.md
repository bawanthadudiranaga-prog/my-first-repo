This is my first GitHub repository.
I’m Bawantha Dudiranaga, an undergraduate student at Gampaha Wickramarachchi University, pursuing a degree in Health Information and Communication Technology (HICT).
I’m passionate about technology, especially in areas like web development, health informatics, and database systems.
I enjoy learning new skills, working on creative ICT projects, and exploring how technology can improve people’s lives.
